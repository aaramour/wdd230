        <h2>Site Purpose:</h2>
        <p>
          The purpose of this site is to benefit the community. It is a place
          for small businesses to visit in order to find/sponsor/create events
          that will have customers. Small businesses will also find other
          businesses they are able to partner with to grow each other. The
          members of the community will find/create/sponsor events to attend to
          bring members of the community together for the benefit of being
          social and creating fellowship, all the while supporting local
          businesses. The ultimate purpose, therefore, is to bring members of
          the community together, whether business owners or patrons, to grow
          Yankeetown.
