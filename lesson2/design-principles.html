        <h3>PARC: Proximity</h3>
        <p>Wikipedia</p>

        <img src="images/wikipedia.png" />
        <p>
          Wikipedia has a good example of proximity on their landing page. While
          it's mostly words and has potential to be confusing, the user can see
          what belongs together based only on proximity. At the bottom of the
          page, the same proximity is achieved with icons.

        <h3>PARC: Alignment</h3>
        <p>Deku Deals</p>
        <a href="https://www.dekudeals.com">dekudeals.com</a>
        <img src="images/dekudeals.png" />
        <p>
          Deku Deals effectively demonstrates alignment by having each picture
          perfectly in line with the others. There are two identical columns and
          each picture aligns with the picture below and and to the side.

        <h3>PARC: Repetition</h3>
        <p>Apple</p>
        <a href="https://www.apple.com">apple.com</a>
        <img src="images/apple.png" />
        <p>
          There aren't many companies more well known than Apple for repetition
          with colors and branding. The stark, clean white that Apple is known
          for is front and center on their site. There is repetition with the
          prevalence of the Apple logo and the 'i' naming convention.
